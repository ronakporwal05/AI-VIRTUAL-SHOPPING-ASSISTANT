## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).
*   A Google Gemini API key.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Get a Gemini API Key**:
    *   Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to generate your free API key.

2.  **Run the Application**:
    *   This is a fully client-side application. No build step is required.
    *   Simply download all the project files and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
    *   For the best experience, it's recommended to serve the files using a local web server (e.g., using the "Live Server" extension in VS Code, or running `python -m http.server` in the project directory).

1.  When you first open the application, you will be prompted to enter your Google Gemini API key.
2.  Paste your key into the input field and click "Start Shopping".
3.  Start chatting with the assistant! You can ask for recommendations like:
    *   "Find me a red dress for under ‚Çπ5000"
    *   "I need some new running shoes"
    *   "What are the most popular headphones right now?"
